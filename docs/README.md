# Welcome to OctoAcme's Project Management Knowledge Base

Welcome! This knowledge base contains OctoAcme's core project management processes, designed to help teams deliver customer value efficiently while maintaining clarity and alignment across stakeholders.

Whether you're a new team member getting oriented, a project manager launching a new initiative, or a developer looking up best practices, this collection of documents will help you understand how we work and why.

## Overview of Project Management Processes

### Purpose and Principles

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

These principles guide how we run all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

### Key Roles

Our project teams typically include:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and business context

### Project Lifecycle Stages

Every project moves through five key stages:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Detail scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on the solution
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, and announce the completed work
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, celebrate wins, and identify action items

### Core Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, we maintain these key artifacts:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Communication Cadence

We maintain consistent communication rhythms:

- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
